### Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. <br />It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.



## <ins>getting started</ins>
<b>1</b> install puppeteer: npm i puppeteer <br />
this might take longer than usual because this is quite a heavy package, that downloads its own version of chrome.
